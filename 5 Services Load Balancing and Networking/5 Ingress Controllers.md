# Ingress Controllers

- In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running.
- Unlike other types of controllers which run as part of the kube-controller-manager binary, Ingress controllers are not started automatically with a cluster.
- Kubernetes as a project currently supports and maintains GCE and nginx controllers.
